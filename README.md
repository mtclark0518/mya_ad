## a couple sentences about the why && what
As a new dev entering the community this project serves to showcase my aptitudes && proficiencies as a web developer, && illustrate my ability to think programatically and communicate that thought process through effective commenting/pseudocode.

## the project
My previous industry was working as a childcare center administrator. Childcare employees face an interesting challenge. The industry as a whole is tech averse, most centers still operate using paper records(mad clutter). Expectations from the state are that daily records are accurate and accountable(duh)... but accurately writing all of the expected details while simultaneously engaging a room full of sub 5 year olds is a legit challenge. Some of the long term goals for this application are listed further down, but currently it's purpose is to provide childcare employees with a tool to accurately maintain their daily logs. Additionally families have access to a family portal where they can sign children into and out of the center. Teachers are able to update student transitions and movements (who was moved, by whom, to where, at what time) are stored in a database. Teachers don't have to think about recordkeeping and administrators can be confident that they have accurate, accountable records.

## project build
1. front end: react(framework), semantic-ui-react(styles), axios(api calls)
2. back end: nodejs(enviroment), express(server/routes), sequelize(database middleware), posgresql(database)
3. hosting: heroku <https://hidden-brushlands-41079.herokuapp.com>

## future goals

1. rewrite(yes, rewrite) application with redux configuartion to manage application state updates.
2. refactor react code into more efficient presentation/container components.
3. rework authentication to utilize bcrypt salt/hash techniques rather than auth0
4. add react push notifications to indicate important state updates.
5. develop log export
6. add a model for non-classroom locations (clubs etc)
